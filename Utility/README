The gosUtility package provides classes useful for manipulating strings,
reading YAML files, correctly working with URLs, and parent/child parallel
processing.


CONFIGURATION

The application root (site root for your website) needs to be set in
gosUtility_URLBuilder (lib/gosUtility/URLBuilder.cls.php)  This is used to
assemble absolute URLs including that root address.
