PHP 5.2.1+ is required for Log5PHP.

To use Log5PHP, you need to define a few constants.

LOG5PHP_CONFIGURATION - location of your xml config file (uses log4j's xml format)
LOG5PHP_LINE_SEP - usually "\n"
LOG5PHP_DIR - path to log4php's src/main/php directory

You then need to load the autoload function:

require_once LOG5PHP_DIR . '/autoload.inc.php';
spl_autoload_register('Log5PHP_autoload');

You're ready to go! Try it out with the root logger -- see below. 
You should shutdown the manager if possible, but it is *mandatory* for appenders
that require shutdown to finish their work, like the Mail appender. Most appenders
do not require an explicit shutdown in order to work -- closing sockets, etc gets
handled by the OS when the process exits.

$logger = Log5PHP_Manager::getRootLogger();

$logger->fatal('Something died');

Log5PHP_Manager::shutdown();
