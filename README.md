## What is it?

Team Lazer Beez Libraries are a collection of code used at one time
by Genius.com and released by the Team Lazer Beez.

The current features of the PHP library are:
  - Output encoding functions for protecting against XSS and similar attacks (http://blog.teamlazerbeez.com/?p=2437)
   - Wrappers for PHP's PCRE library to report all errors as exceptions (http://blog.teamlazerbeez.com/?p=2569)

## Using Team Lazer Beez Libraries

Each of the gos* modules is a package.  To use any package, you will need
the "gosCore" package, which contains some common libraries shared by other
modules.

The latest version of the Team Lazer Beez Libraries can be found at the
Genius project site on the GitHub at https://github.com/teamlazerbeez/PHP
